# Platform for Representation and Integration of multimodal Molecular Embeddings [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07367)

To run SVCCA analysis between embeddings,
```shell
python compare_all.py
```

To train PRISME and generate the multimodal molecular embeddings,
```shell
python run.py
```

To run benchmarking tasks on gene dosage sensitivity, gene–gene interaction, Gene Ontology (GO), protein–protein interaction (PPI) and protein subcellular localization
```shell
python compare_all.py
```

To train an imputation model,
```shell
python impute_train.py
```

For molecular embedding collection methods and other benchmarking tasks, please refer to supplemetary section of our paper.
